This tiny library is using Object.observe (and Array.observe) to build a 2-way
data binding library with the current HTML5 specs.

It uses `<template>` elements as well when needed.

Not all browsers currently support Object.observe, or `<template>`, or other
cutting edge features this library may be using, and it's only tested in
Chrome.
